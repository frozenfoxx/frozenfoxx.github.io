Added a new section to the Wiki, this one dealing with the dreaded [Solaris Cluster](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Solaris_Cluster)!  Previously called Sun Cluster I had to use this a lot in the past for MySQL and Ingres databases so I had a quick "survival guide" of commands I'd dug out through the years that should assist any intrepid admin who's stuck trying to get one of those setups back online.  Unfortunately a comprehensive guide's a little much to ask for since it's a very complicated and touchy piece of software but hopefully what's currently in there will be enough.  If I find any other notes I think are relevant I'll have them up shortly.
