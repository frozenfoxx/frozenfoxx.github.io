I've updated the Wiki of Foxx with a howto guide on [How to build a MiniNOC](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=MiniNOC_with_a_Beaglebone_Black).  In this case this is using a Beaglebone Black, other entries using other equipment will definitely be considered for future articles.  Total cost of this project if you've already got a spare monitor lying around is about $60 or so, but if you want to power multiples of these then you can reuse powered USB hubs and not have to buy multiple SDcards obviously.

While not explicitly noted consider kitting out Firefox with some extensions to make life easier, like an automatic refresh or tab switcher so you can watch multiple things simultaneously.  The big benefit of using Firefox in this build is the ability to get extensions so go nuts.
