New entry added to the wiki of Foxx, this time on [Solaris CLI](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Solaris_CLI).  I did Solaris administration for a long time and as a native Linux fan I found many of its commands to be useful but quite arcane.  Documentation I didn't think was nearly as good or helpful so I had to compile a list of useful Solaris commands over the years.  Hopefully no admin will have to use this page, but if you find yourself in a Solaris box and need to reconfigure a service this page should help get you through it.
