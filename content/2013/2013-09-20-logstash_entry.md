New page in the wiki, [Logstash](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Logstash).  It's not complete yet, but it's currently got the basic info on how to get the nuts-and-bolts of Logstash up and rolling, sans init.d files at this time.  It also doesn't talk about the front-end, Kibana, but those notes combined with the excellent docs at logstash.net should get any new user off the group and indexing all those messy log files in no time.
