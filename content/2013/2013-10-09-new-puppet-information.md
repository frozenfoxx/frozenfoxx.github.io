A whole lot of new information regarding installing and setting up Puppet has been added to the [Wiki](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Puppet).  There may be a little *too* much in some of the examples (such as setting reporting to true on the puppet master prior to adding Foreman) but it should be otherwise all good to go, ready-to-drop in stuff.  Please enjoy and know that over time I'll be adding a lot more info on Puppet.  If you're an admin, you NEED Puppet.
