The new Foreman page on the Wiki of Foxx is now available [http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Foreman](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Foreman)!  The Foreman is a control and reporting frontend for Puppet that generally works pretty well.  The instructions don't cover EVERY possible combination and generally using the installation script is recommended, but my method is pretty stripped down and straightforward which should work for almost anywhere that already has a Puppet installation rolling that you don't want to mess with.
