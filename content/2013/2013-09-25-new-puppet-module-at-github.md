Got a new Puppet module in training at [https://github.com/frozenfoxx/puppet-repo](https://github.com/frozenfoxx/puppet-repo).  When completed it'll allow you to specify via Hiera any arbitrary number of repositories and have them added to the puppet slaves.  Should be nearly complete now but I need to do some heavier duty testing.  I'll do my best to get it onto the Puppet Forge when finished but I've never actually published up there before so hopefully it won't be too bad of a learning experience.

Anyway let me know on Github if there's something you'd like me to change.  At the moment I'm just trying to support yum but long term I want it to support almost any package repository so please feel free to submit some pull requests.
