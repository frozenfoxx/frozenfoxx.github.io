There's been a new entry added to the wiki of Foxx that has to do with using a serial console, located [here](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Serial_Console).  At the moment it only describes the raw basics of using Oracle/Sun's SPARC system ALOM, ILOM, and XSCF but if you ever have to deal with one of those systems' serial console this quick list of commands for all of those should help out quite a bit when you're in a hurry and need to power cycle a machine remotely and then log into it.

Eventually I'd like to include some info about using a serial console with Linux and x86(_64) systems but unfortunately I can't find a whole lot of info to try out.  Seems KVM is just more popular for that hardware.
