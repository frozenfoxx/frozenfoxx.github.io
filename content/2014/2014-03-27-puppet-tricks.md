New entry in the Wiki of Foxx, [Puppet Tricks](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Puppet_Tricks)! This page will be dedicated to solutions in Puppet for typical and some not-so-typical sysadmin problems. Things like adding repoes to all your servers, changing up hostnames, turning off services, or all that kinda stuff. Eventually I may stick MCollective stuff in there but if there's a lot of MCollective tricks they may get dedicated to their own page.  If you've wanted to try out Puppet but take a look at the overmassive deathsphere of documentation and say, "my gods, it's full of a startling lack of examples of getting shit done," then this page is for you.  I fear it might get a little long eventually but I'm going to try to keep it to trim, simple, and straightforward guides on how to get shit done without a ton of dependencies.
