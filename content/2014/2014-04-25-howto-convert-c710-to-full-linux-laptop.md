Today the long-awaited guide on how to convert an Acer C710 Chromebook into a full Linux laptop has been posted [here](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=Convert_Acer_C710_Chromebook_to_Linux_Laptop).  It borrows and coalesces and condenses from some other guides into a single, one-stop-shop for conversion with page links for in-depth references.

The short version is that you'll need:

* an Acer C710
* a USB thumbstick
* 4/8GB of RAM
* an Internet connection (wired/wireless)
* a larger SSD (or hard drive, I suppose)
* About an hour or two of total time
* About thirty minutes of time for work

As of this writing this Chromebook is fully supported by Ubuntu 13.10+ and works marvellously with a decent battery life.  Total cost of the project was about $350 ($200 for the Chromebook, $100 for the 120GB SSD and $50 for the memory sticks).  For additional fun you can still leave ChromeOS installed in a very small partition so if you get tired of Linux you can easily flip back to ChromeOS.  Happy hacking!
