Hooray, I put up my quick-n-dirty instructions on PuppetDB on the [Wiki of Foxx](http://wiki.churchoffoxx.net/index.php?title=PuppetDB).  Please enjoy responsibly as this is a super-awesome addition to any Puppet setup.  Not only does it allow you to use "exported resources (i.e. very nifty way of passing info around to different nodes without any of them knowing where it came from)" to do stuff like dynamically build Apache and Nagios configurations but it ALSO is blazing quick for resource lookups and catalog preparations.

Generally I recommend the quicker, easier yum instructions over the source instructions but then I've used both to great success so do whatever works for you.
