After a lot of thought I've moved my hosting for the site entirely over to Github.  It was already serving as a mirror for backup and since there's no reason to use SSL on the site anymore (there's only static content) it seemed like I might as well move it all there.  The Puppet code has been updated to reflect this with an excellent example of how easy it is to get Nginx up and rolling using Puppet, the Wiki is now entirely hosted at Github, and all changes henceforth will be made there directly.  For the interested the base repo is naturally at [https://github.com/frozenfoxx/frozenfoxx.github.io](https://github.com/frozenfoxx/frozenfoxx.github.io) and the wiki is at [https://github.com/frozenfoxx/frozenfoxx.github.io/wiki](https://github.com/frozenfoxx/frozenfoxx.github.io/wiki).  Big plus, this means no more screwing around with Mediawiki.
