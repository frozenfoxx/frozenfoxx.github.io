Trying to launch [ZDL](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL) on a modern Windows system will sometimes result in a very unhelpful error box pop-up that simply reads, `MSVCR100.dll is missing`. This is not referring to _just_ the DLL but it's what first causes an issue so that's what the error returns. So how do you fix this?

This is because the system is missing the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999). To fix, go to the Microsoft Download Center, search for this redistributable, and download both the `x86` and `x64` versions. Install these, and then try to launch ZDL. It may take a minute, but should work just fine.
